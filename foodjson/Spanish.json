As the tortilla sets, occasionally shake the pan and run the spatula along the rim to keep the tortilla from sticking. Cook until the eggs are almost set, 25 to 35 minutes.\nMeanwhile, make the pimentón aioli. In a small bowl, stir together mayonnaise, pimentón, Tabsaco, and garlic. Refrigerate until ready to use.\nWhen you can easily lift the side of the tortilla up with the spatula and see underneath, it is ready to flip. Place a plate, platter, or inverted or rimless baking sheet larger than the skillet on top of the tortilla in the skillet, then flip the skillet over so the tortilla transfers onto the plate. Slide the tortilla back into the skillet and add any runny egg that was left on the plate. Continue to cook until tortilla is light golden on the underside, pushing the edges under to give it a nice round shape, 5 to 7 minutes more.\nFlip tortilla onto a wire rack to cool. To serve, thinly slice around the perimeter to square off the sides (save those for a cook's treat). Cut the tortilla in 6 equal rows lengthwise and widthwise to make 36 bites. Serve tortilla with aioli for dipping.\nDO AHEAD: The tortilla can be made 3 days in advance, kept whole, wrapped tightly in plastic, and refrigerated. The aioli can be made 3 days in advance and refrigerated.",
